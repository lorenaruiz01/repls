# 2.7: Non-Relational Databases & MongoDB

### Intro
- you should strive for the same type of uniformity required in SQL databases even within your NoSQL databases.
- the key advantage to using non-relational databases is the flexibility it provides for changing up your database if you need to (without having to perform complex modifications on your current database).

### MongoDB
 - MongoDB Community Server: This is the Mongo server that interacts with incoming commands over the network, processes the commands, and stores data. You’ll be using the “community” edition, since it’s free and sufficient for your project, rather than the “enterprise” edition.
