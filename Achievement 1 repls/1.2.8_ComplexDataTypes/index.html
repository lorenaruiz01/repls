<script>
  var car1 = {

  };

  // The next code line implies: let car2 refer to what car1 is referring at
  var car2 = car1;

  console.log(car1); // {model: 2019, color: "red"};
  console.log(car2); // {model: 2019, color: "red"};

  // changing `model` property of the object referred by car1
  car1.model = 2018;

  console.log(car1); // {model: 2018, color: "red"}
  console.log(car2); // {model: 2018, color: "red"} -> notice that model is now also 2018, even if the change was done through car1
