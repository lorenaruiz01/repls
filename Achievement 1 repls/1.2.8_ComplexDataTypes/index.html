  var car2 = car1;

  // changing `model` property of the object referred by car1
  car1.model = 2018;

  console.log(car1); // {model: 2018, color: "red"}
  console.log(car2); // {model: 2018, color: "red"} -> notice that model is now also 2018, even if the change was done through car1

// take a new variable, day, that stores a string and assign it a value, say “Sunday”. Write the if, else if, and else statements to print “It’s the weekend! Yay!” in the console for the values Saturday and Sunday, and print “It’s not the weekend! Boo!” for all the other days. Change the value of day to see how it changes the console output.
